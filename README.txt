Here are some minimalist games made for beginners who want to learn OCaml.

In each directory several files represent an evolution of the game
from a very minimal state (file number 0) and the following files add new
elements, features or refinements of the source code.

The documentation is provided into separated files with the same number
and -en for English language and -fr for French language.

All the examples need OCamlSDL2 to work.
